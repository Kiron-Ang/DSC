# DSC: Data Science Coursework

This repository contains projects and assignments I've completed for
data science (DSC) and bioinformatics (BINF) courses at Baylor
University. I will graduate in December 2025 with a BS in
Informatics. My major is bioinformatics, hence why I take both data
science courses and bioinformatics courses. Please contact 
kiron_ang1@baylor.edu if you have any questions, suggestions, or
concerns.
