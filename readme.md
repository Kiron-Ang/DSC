# DSC: Data Science Coursework

Welcome to my repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects Iâ€™ve independently completed as part of my coursework in Data Science (DSC) and Bioinformatics (BINF) at Baylor University. I'm currently working toward my Bachelor of Science in Informatics, with a focus on Bioinformatics, and I'm on track to graduate in December 2025. My studies blend data science and bioinformatics, giving me a well-rounded understanding of both fields.
