# Misleading Statistics
### Kiron Ang, November 2024

I recently read Darrell Huff's 1954 book *How to Lie with Statistics*. 
Below are some misleading statistics from recent news articles:

1. An example of Chapter 1's "The Sample with the Built-in Bias"

2. An example of Chapter 2's "The Well-Chosen Average"

3. An example of Chapter 3's "The Little Figures That Are Not There"

4. An example of Chapter 4's "Much Ado about Practically Nothing"

5. An example of Chapter 8's "Post Hoc Rides Again"
